; This is the very beginning of Dinosaur OS! It simply loads the second-stage
; bootloader and executes it. It does not handle the transition from real-mode
; to protected mode to long mode, which is reserved for the second stage loader.
;
; After this bootloader has finished executing, here is what will result (if
; everything works OK):
;
; 1. SS and FS will be set up to use the maximum space possible
;
; 2. SS will be at 0x1000 and above (used for stack)
;
; 3. FS will be at 0x2000 and above (used as data buffer for reading disks)


[BITS 16]		; In real mode, every instruction is 16 bits
[ORG 0x7C00]	; This is where our code will be loaded, so we calculate
				; addresses from here

%define CR 13
%define LF 10
