# Welcome to Dinosaur!

Dinosaur is a new operating system designed for multimedia production using the AMD64 architecture. It also possesses ThunderViper, a Python compiler that "Thunderizes" Python code and converts it to system-level Assembly! With all powers combined, this should make a very fast and pleasent operating system to use.

## How do I get started?

It is recommended until Dinosaur matures to use a virtual machine in order to test out Dinosaur's capabilities. The build instructions assume that you are using VirtualBox as your virtual machine. Also, it is assumed you have a 64-bit processor (which if you don't, Dinosaur will not work for you).

### Windows

The build scripts required to build and create a valid VirtualBox image containing Dinosaur can be found in the folder **build_win.**
